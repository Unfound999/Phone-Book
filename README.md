A simple little Phone Book/Contact Manager for the terminal, written using Linked Lists.

## For Extra Credit:
* We used, and would recommend, the following Youtube video to learn more about Linked Lists (https://youtu.be/N6dOwBde7-M?si=Wmha_1gQL4VaqfLT)
* We used the following resource to generate ASCII art for our menu. (https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=3D%20Diagonal&t=)
* We added sorting of our contact list via selection sort. See src/PhoneBookManager.java lines 155-243.
